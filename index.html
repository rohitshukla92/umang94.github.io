					Okay .. so German Language .. Now for all those people who have English as their first language.. A sincere Request, Guys never start with German if u want to take up a foreign language. Start with anything else but not German. Its not that German is bad but the thing with German is that its very confusing specially for people who have got no  prior experience in German. I  myself struggled so hard that i ended up writing this hate note against German :D. 
					Initially German requires a hell lot of your memorizing powers. You have only only one article in English that is "THE". In German there 3 main articles and then as many as 9 of their derivatives. Each word has a article assigned to it. Ohh n BTW they made articles for Male Female and Neutral Gender but forgot that when they were building the language. As a result you will taught about the different articles for the different Genders but when it comes to using them .. you will suddenly realize that they have 100s of exceptions.
					Only native Germans can remember all those different articles. Now if u r hell bent to go n start with German .. then an advice ..  buddy atleast find a native German to teach you German. Else you are dead!!!! ...
